4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
{Man}         Pod 08 was unable to breach target orbital range due to insufficient altitude.

5
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
{Aoba}        Copy that.

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
{Woman}       Pod 02-Dash will enter the final operational orbit.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
{Hyuga}       Pod 02-Dash will transition to the intersection orbit.

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
{Misato}      02-Dash, prepare to rendezvous.

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
{Misato}      08 is lacking altitude, so it can only assist you in the 96 seconds until re-entry.

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
{Misato}      Finish this by then.

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
{Hyuga}       Reflective waves detected in target space.

56
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
{Hyuga}       It's jamming us!

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
{Aoba}        It's just the auto-defense system's mass weapon.

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
{Aoba}        No need to worry.

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
{Man}         Burst flows generated!

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
{Man}         Incoming in 3... 2... 1...

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
{Aoba}        Blood type: blue.

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
{Aoba}        They're a pesky bunch.

64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
{Man}         Identifying approaching body...

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:25,000
{Man}         Confirmed to be Code 04A.

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,000
{Asuka}       An Anti-A.T. Field!

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
{Asuka}       This sucks!

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
{Asuka}       It's just getting in my way!

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
{Asuka}       Hey, Glasses! Some backup here!

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
{Asuka}       Support fire was two seconds late!

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
{Mari}        And you're three seconds ahead of position.

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
{Asuka}       It's called adapting to the situation. Keep up with me!

73
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
{Mari}        As you command,

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:05,000
{Mari}        Princess!

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
{Asuka}       It got through the Fraury Shift.

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
{Asuka}       It'll break into Final Defense Area 89.

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
{Asuka}       The target is moving!

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
{Asuka}       No time to correct my orbit!

79
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:40,000
{Asuka}       I'm going in!

80
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
{Asuka}       Decelerate!

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
{Asuka}       Eight!

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
{Asuka}       Seven!

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
{Asuka}       Six!

84
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
{Asuka}       Five!

85
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
{Asuka}       Four!

86
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
{Asuka}       Three!

87
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
{Asuka}       Two!

88
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
{Asuka}       One!

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:03,000
{Asuka}       Terminating combustion!

90
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
{Woman}       02-Dash has jettisoned the last boosters.

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
{Woman}       Ensuring safe distance for re-entry.

92
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
{Asuka}       Successfully seized the target.

93
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
{Asuka}       Returning to base.

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
{Misato}      Roger.

95
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
{Misato}      We'll be waiting at the retrieval point.

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
{Misato}      The join code is Saturn 5.

97
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
{Asuka}       Roger.

98
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
{Asuka}       Blood type blue?

99
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
{Asuka}       Where?!

100
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
{Woman}       The triggering object is Code 04B.

101
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
{Woman}       It's deploying indo-hashamas.

102
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
{Asuka}       The nerve!

103
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
{Asuka}       Right before re-entry, too.

104
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
{Asuka}       Glasses, back-up!

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
{Mari}        Sorry!

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
{Mari}        I don't have enough altitude, so c'ya!

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
{Mari}        I'll leave the rest to y-...

108
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
{Asuka}       Ugh! She's useless!

109
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
{Asuka}       Damn, this thing is stubborn!

110
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:59,000
{Asuka}       Nobody told me about this!

111
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
{Asuka}       What's with this light?!

112
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
{Asuka}       The A.T. Field isn't neutralizing it!

113
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
{Asuka}       Gotta do a core block!

114
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
{Asuka}       You're not getting away!

115
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
{Asuka}       Crap! I can't maintain my descent angle!

116
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
{Asuka}       My unit will break apart at this rate!

117
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
{Misato}      02-Dash, completing the mission takes top priority!

118
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
{Misato}      Don't let go of the target object, even if it means sacrificing the unit.

119
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:41,000
{Asuka}       I already know that!

120
00:06:41,000 --> 00:07:23,000
{Asuka}       Do something, you idiot, Shinji!

121
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
{Kaworu}      Welcome home, Ikari Shinji-kun.

122
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:42,000
{Kaworu}      I've been waiting for you.

123
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
{Sakura}      Cardiopulmonary function is nominal.

124
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
{Sakura}      No discernible paralysis of the extremities.

125
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
{Sakura}      Yes. His eyes are opening.

126
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
{Sakura}      Can you understand me?

127
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
{Shinji}      What is this place?

128
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
{Sakura}      He's responsive.

129
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
{Sakura}      He seems to have returned to a conscious state.

130
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
{Shinji}      Really, we have to help Ayanami.

131
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
{Sakura}      Yes, continuity of memory also seems acceptable.

132
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
{Shinji}      Um, where's Ayanami...?

133
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
{Sakura}      Is this someone you know?

134
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
{Shinji}      It's... me.

135
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
{Sakura}      He is capable of self-recognition as well.

136
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
{Sakura}      There seems to be no problem.

137
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
{Shinji}      The hell...?

138
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
{Woman}       Installation list for refill operations cleared up to 86%.

139
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
{Koji}        Online N2 reactor maintaining output of 90%.

140
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
{Midori}      No ships visible within a perimeter of 1200.

141
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
{Midori}      No unidentified flying objects can be confirmed, either.

142
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
{Aoba}        Prioritize ships in the D block for the transferral of crew.

143
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
{Hyuga}       / We don't have enough personnel for the transfer operation!{＃＃転入作業の人手がまるで足りない (日向の台詞)}

144
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
{Sumire}      / ＃＃＃＃＃にずれがあり

145
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,000
{Tama}        Checking the roadmap for the camouflage operation.

146
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
{Sakura}      Specimen DM03 is in our custody.

147
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
{Misato}      Understood.

148
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
{Misato}      Release the restraints.

149
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:25,000
{Misato}      You can step down.

150
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
{Shinji}      Misato-san...

151
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
{Misato}      It is Ikari Shinji-kun, isn't it?

152
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
{Ritsuko}     So it would seem.

153
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
{Ritsuko}     His physical data is identical to Code Third Boy.

{Ritsuko}     / Post birth dental treatment scars and body composition are reproduced perfectly by(?) Near Surge.

155
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
{Ritsuko}     We are now analyzing his deep level sync test results.

156
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
{Misato}      And the application of the DSS Choker?

157
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
{Ritsuko}     Its installation has already been arranged, Captain Katsuragi.

158
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
{Shinji}      Captain Katsuragi...?

159
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:03,000
{Shinji}      It is you after all!

160
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000

161
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000

162
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
{Misato}      Understood.

163
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
{Shinji}      What is this thing?!

164
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
{Shinji}      Please, take it off already!

165
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
{Sakura}      That's never going to be taken off.

166
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
{Misato}      Interview complete.

167
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
{Misato}      Take him to quarantine.

168
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
{Midori}      Decoys 01 and 05 destroyed.

169
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
{Midori}      Insufficiency in wave's length.

170
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
{Misato}      The hell's this?

171
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
{Hyuga}       It's Pattern Blue.

172
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000

173
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
{Hyuga}       Code 4C.

174
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
{Hyuga}       It's the Nemesis Series.

175
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
{Misato}      They're back...

176
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,000
{Midori (BG)} Targets are all Code 4C.

177
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
{Ritsuko}     They're advancing on all sides.

178
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
{Ritsuko}     They intend to cordon us here, to start with.

181
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
{Misato}      Continue only with main engine's operations.

182
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
{Misato}      All fleets to Second Battle Stations.

183

{Misato}      Target: All Nemesis Series.

184
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
{Ritsuko}     Roger.

185
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
{Ritsuko}     All fleets to Second Battle Stations.

186
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
{Hyuga}       Prepare for anti-air, anti-water, and underwater battle.

187
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
{Aoba}        Abandon stock transfer.

188
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
{Aoba}        Prioritize the transferring of all personnel to another vessel.

189
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
{Woman}       All fleets, abandoning stock transfer.

190
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000

191
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
{Woman}       All aircraft are to withdraw from our current air space.

192
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000

193
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
{Man}         Abandon any leftover cargo.

194
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
{Man}         Migration of crew takes top priority.

197
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
{Woman}       Prepare all cannons to shoot.

198
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
{Woman}       Remote control and interlock systems, activating.

201
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
{Koji}        Hurry.

202
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
{Man}         N2 Reactor operating at 99%.

203

{Woman}       Initiating main power system injection.

204
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
{Woman}       Opening valves up to number 90.

205
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
{Woman}       Transmission pipe connected.

206
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
{Woman}       No problems detected in the port, and 3rd and 4th cargo cage.

{Man}         Roger.

208
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
{Man}         Opening all valves up to 90.

209
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
{Man}         Begin energy injection.

210
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
{Woman}       Injecting power to N2 reactor.

211
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,000
{Woman}       All nominal.

212
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
{Woman}       Verifying the interior of the LCL tube.

213
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
{Woman}       Filtration system is go.

214
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
{Maya}        Battle stations!

215
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
{Maya}        Get back to your departments.

216
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
{Maya}        You there! No idling!

217
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
{Worker}      You're asking for the impossible, Ma'am!

218
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
{Worker}      We are something of a mixed group with civilians amongst us, after all.

219
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
{Maya}        No excuses!

220
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
{Maya}        Get to work!

221
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
{Maya}        Ugh, this is why I can't stand younger men.

222
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
{Tama}        Umm... interrupting the transfer here.

223
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
{Tama}        Commencing lockdown of barrier walls... is this it?

224
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
{Midori}      The sonar is in this direction with the bow of the anti-air ship as reference.

225
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
{Aoba}        Kitakami!

226
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
{Aoba}        What's the status of the procedures on deck?

227
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
{Midori}      Am I in charge of that?

228
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
{Aoba}        That's your post! Of course!

229
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
{Midori}      Whaat? For real?

230
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
{Sakura}      The start-up is dangerous.

231
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
{Sakura}      Let's stay here!

232
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
{Woman (BG)}  Preparations for all anti-air defenses concluded, including the guided missiles of the battle ship.

233
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
{Sakura}      Having battle stations on the bridge...

234
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,000
{Misato}      Roger.

235
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
{Sakura}      It's so nerve-wracking!

236
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
{Misato}      Activate all anti-air systems.

237
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
{Misato}      Safeguarding Eva-01 is our number-one priority.

238
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:07,000
{Shinji}      ...Eva-01?

239
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
{Midori}      It's here!

240
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
{Midori}      Confirming the target's pillar of light.

241
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
{Midori}      Its... numbers are increasing somehow!

242
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
{Aoba}        We can't grasp the target's core block.

243
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
{Aoba}        It is probably being concealed on the outside of a phased cocoon.

244
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
{Ritsuko}     This is bad.

245
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
{Ritsuko}     At this rate, we'll be on the receiving end of a saturation bombing.

246
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
{Midori}      600 seconds until contact.

247
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
{Ritsuko}     Captain Katsuragi,

248
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
{Ritsuko}     I propose an immediate dispersal of the fleets.

249
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
{Ritsuko}     We have insufficient crew and limited resources.

250
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
{Ritsuko}     Compounding the problem, this main ship's camouflage equipment is incomplete.

251
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
{Ritsuko}     On top of that, we cannot attack to capture the target's core block.

252
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
{Ritsuko}     In other words, our chance of winning is zero.

253
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
{Ritsuko}     At this point, we should retreat like we usually do.

254
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
{Ritsuko}     There is no way.

255
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
{Ritsuko}     Captain Katsuragi!

256
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
{Misato}      This is why I will change the current situation to neutralize any possibly anxiety.

257
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
{Misato}      Vice Captain, we're going to fly.

258
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
{Ritsuko}     Fly?!

259
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
{Ritsuko}     You can't be thinking of using the main ship?

260
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
{Misato}      All hands, prepare for launch!

261
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
{Misato}      Prepare for ignition of the main engines!

262
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
{Ritsuko}     It's too reckless to use the main ship all of a sudden, Captain Katsuragi!

263
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
{Tama}        I agree!

264
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
{Tama}        We haven't even run a test flight. It's too dangerous.

265
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
{Sumire}      Anti-gravity also hasn't been tested.

266
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
{Sumire}      I don't have confidence in it.

267
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
{Midori}      I don't want to fight battles that can't be won.

268
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
{Midori}      I don't want to die just yet.

269
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
{Koji}        You die when you die. That's all there is to it.

270
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
{Koji}        Quit complaining, younglings.

271
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
{Midori}      Wah... Elders should be more careful!

272
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
{Misato}      I am aware of the recklessness.

273
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
{Misato}      We will use this ship as decoy and fish it out to the surface!

274
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
{Misato}      The power to kill gods. I will see it through to the end.

275
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
{Ritsuko}     But the most important ignition system has not been installed.

276
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
{Ritsuko}     Don't tell me you're going to use the Evas?

277
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
{Misato}      Mari!

278
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
{Mari}        Eva-08 isn't ready yet.

279
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
{Misato}      Asuka!

280
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
{Shinji}      ...Asuka?

281
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
{Asuka}       I'm already on it!

282
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
{Asuka}       I just have to shove the ignition engine in, right?

283
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
{Misato}      I'm counting on you.

284
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
{Ritsuko}     But there is a problem with the barrier density around the ship.

285
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
{Ritsuko}     Plus, isn't there work being done on the bridge?

286
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
{Asuka}       Well, "prioritize the objective, human life expendable" is a captain's motto, after all.

287
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
{Asuka}       I'm going all out!

288
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
{Asuka}       Eva Unit 02', activate!

289
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
{Woman}       Eva-02' is launching.

290
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
{Woman}       Roger.

291
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
{Woman}       Preparing Eva-02' for launch.

292
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:20,000
{Woman}       Underwater motor and jet propulsion, passing through number 1.

293
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:32,000
{Asuka}       Really, such a boring entrance for my unit's new looks.

294
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
{Shinji}      It really is Eva-02.

295
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:40,000
{Shinji}      Thank god. Asuka is okay.

296
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
{Shinji}      Misato, I...

297
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
{Misato}      All fleets to Primary Battle Stations.

298
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
{Man}         All fleets to Primary Battle Stations.

299
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
{Man}         Repeat, all fleets to Primary Battle Stations.

300
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
{Ritsuko}     Changing battle command system.

301
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
{Ritsuko}     Main crew, to the main bridge.

323
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000

426
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
{Woman (BG)}  Artillery systems are interlocked.

427
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
{Hyuga}       Direct aim and manual pursuit, good to go on all cannons.

428
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
{Misato}      Then we're all set.

429
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:56,000
{Misato}      FIRE!

430
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000

431
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
{Misato}      All fleets, go to secondary state of alert.

432
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000

433
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000

434
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
{Tama}        Amazing!

435
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
{Midori}      We really won.

436
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
{Koji}        How totally reckless.

437
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
{Koji}        Well, she's an even more interesting captain than Kaji said.

438
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
{Ritsuko}     So this is the power to kill gods.

439
00:24:17,000 --> 00:25:00,000
{Ritsuko}     Wunder really is the ship of hope.

440
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
{Sakura}      Specimen DM03, Tentative Name Ikari Shinji-san...

441
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
{Sakura}      The executive officer will have a word with you.

442
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
{Shinji}      This is Eva-01...?

443
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
{Ritsuko}     Yes. Eva-01 is being used as the main engine of this ship.

444
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
{Ritsuko}     Consequently, you serve no use as a pilot.

445
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
{Shinji}      Ah, so I really am not needed.

446
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
{Ritsuko}     Also, your sync test results have come back.

447
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
{Ritsuko}     The sync rate is 0.00%.

448
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
{Ritsuko}     Even if you were to get in the Eva, it wouldn't activate.

449
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
{Sakura}      Really?

450
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
{Sakura}      Isn't that great news, Ikari-san?

451
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,000
{Ritsuko}     Even so, we cannot overlook the fact that, earlier, Eva-01 suddenly entered an Awakened state for 12 seconds.

452
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
{Ritsuko}     As a result, the DSS Choker has been installed on you.

453
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
{Shinji}      What is this?

454
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
{Ritsuko}     Safety for us.

455
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
{Ritsuko}     It's a physical safety device to circumvent Awakenings.

456
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
{Ritsuko}     And it is also a symbol of your punishment.

457
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
{Shinji}      What does it do?

458
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:04,000
{Ritsuko}     If you lose control of your emotions while piloting an Eva and become unable to suppress the risk of Awakening,

459
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
{Ritsuko}     this will intervene by terminating your life.

460
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
{Shinji}      Does that mean... I will die?

461
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
{Ritsuko}     I will not deny that.

462
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
{Shinji}      No way...

463
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
{Shinji}      Misato-san, what is all this about dying?

464
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
{Shinji}      This is weird, Misato-san!

465
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
{Shinji}      Suddenly it's all so confusing, and I don't understand anything!

466
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
{Ritsuko}     It can't be helped that you're confused.

467
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
{Ritsuko}     Second Lieutenant!

468
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
{Sakura}      Yes, ma'am!

469
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
{Ritsuko}     Introduce yourself.

470
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
{Sakura}      Yes, ma'am!

471
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
{Sakura}      Um, it's late, but I'm the medical officer in charge,

472
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
{Sakura}      2nd Lt. Suzuhara Sakura.

473
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
{Sakura}      Nice to meet you.

474
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
{Shinji}      Ah, s-same.

475
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
{Shinji}      But, "Suzuhara"...

476
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
{Shinji}      Are you Toji's...?

477
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
{Sakura}      Ah, yes.

478
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
{Sakura}      I owe everything to my big brother.

479
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
{Sakura}      I'm his little sister Sakura.

480
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
{Shinji}      Little sister?

481
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
{Shinji}      Don't you mean big sister?

482
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
{Sakura}      No, little sister.

483
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
{Shinji}      Little sister...? How?

484
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
{Asuka}       Fourteen years have passed since then.

485
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
{Asuka}       Stupid Shinji.

486
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,000
{Shinji}      Huh? Ah, Asuka!

487
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
{Shinji}      Thank god.

488
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:23,000
{Shinji}      You really are safe, Asuka!

489
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
{Asuka}       I can't stand this.

490
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:34,000
{Asuka}       I've been holding this in.

491
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
{Shinji}      What was that all about...?

492
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
{Asuka}       Built up anger and grief.

493
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
{Shinji}      What do you mean...?

494
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
{Shinji}      Uh, Asuka, your left eye...

495
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
{Asuka}       None of your business.

496
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
{Shinji}      Asuka, you said it's been fourteen years,

497
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
{Shinji}      but the only thing that's changed about you is that eyepatch.

498
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
{Asuka}       Right. It's the Curse of Eva.

499
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
{Shinji}      A curse?

500
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
{Shinji}      Wait!

501
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
{Shinji}      Asuka, maybe you know!

502
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
{Shinji}      Where's Ayanami?!

503
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
{Asuka}       Dunno.

504
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
{Shinji}      You don't know...?

505
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
{Shinji}      But I saved her!

506
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
{Asuka}       All this fuss over just one person.

507
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
{Asuka}       This world doesn't have time to cater to your ego.

508
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,000
{Asuka}       Isn't that right, Captain Katsuragi?

509
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
{Shinji}      Asuka!

510
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
{Shinji}      Misato-san, where's Ayanami?!

511
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
{Shinji}      You've got to tell me!

512
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
{Misato}      Shinji-kun, Ayanami Rei no longer exists.

513
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
{Shinji}      No, I saved her, I know I did.

514
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
{Shinji}      She must still be in Eva-01's plug.

515
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
{Shinji}      Please, search for her!

516
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
{Ritsuko}     We've already conducted a thorough sweep of Eva-01.

517
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
{Ritsuko}     We only found you.

518
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
{Ritsuko}     And for some reason, this was restored.

519
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
{Ritsuko}     The inspection yielded no problems. We'll return it.

520
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
{Shinji}      My father's...。

521
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
{Shinji}      Ayanami was holding it then.

522
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
{Shinji}      So I saved her, didn't I?

523
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
{Shinji}      What?!

524
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
{Misato}      It's me.

525
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
{Hyuga (Phone)} Target is on the rear deck!

526
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
{Hyuga (Phone)} It suddenly closed in on us!

527
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
{Misato}      So the champion is on the scene...

528
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
{Misato}      All fleets to Primary Battle Stations.

529
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
{Misato}      Safeguarding Eva-01 is top priority!

530
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
{Asuka}       Eva-08, you're ready to go, right?

531
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
{Mari}        But of course.

532
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
{Mari}        I'm right on top of it, Princess.

533
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
{Mari}        By the way, how was Puppy Boy?

534
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
{Mari}        Is he obediently staying put?

535
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
{Asuka (Phone)} Nothing's changed about his stupid lowly face.

536
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
{Mari}        Oh, so you went to go see his face, did you?

537
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
{Asuka (Phone)} No!

538
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
{Asuka (Phone)} Just strike!

539
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
{Asuka}       I feel much better now.

540
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
{Shinji}      Misato-san, Ritsuko-san!

541
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
{Shinji}      Just who is coming?

542
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
{Shinji}      Is it a new Angel?!

543
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
{Rei}         Ikari-kun, where are you?

544
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
{Shinji}      Ayanami?

545
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
{Shinji}      That was Ayanami's voice just now, wasn't it?!

546
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
{Shinji}      Misa-

547
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
{Shinji}      What is going on here?!

548
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
{Sakura}      Preparations complete!

549
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
{Sakura}      Ikari-san, this way!

550
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
{Rei}         Ikari-kun, where are you?

551
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
{Shinji}      It really is Ayanami.

552
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
{Shinji}      It's Ayanami!

553
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,000
{Sakura}      Ikari-san! Quickly!

554
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
{Shinji}      Enough.

555
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:28,000
{Shinji}      Ayanami, I'm right here!

556
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
{Shinji}      Eva... Unit 00.

557
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
{Rei}         Ikari-kun...

558
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
{Rei}         Come this way.

559
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
{Misato}      Don't do it, Shinji-kun.

560
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
{Misato}      Just stay right here.

561
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
{Shinji}      What's with that, Misato-san?

562
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
{Shinji}      Weren't you just saying a moment ago that you didn't need me?

563
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
{Misato}      Even so, you'll be kept in our custody.

564
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:53,000
{Shinji}      That's just too one-sided!

565
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,000
{Shinji}      Please stop it!

566
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
{Shinji}      The target is an Eva!

567
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
{Misato}      That's why.

568
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
{Misato}      We will eradicate all of Nerv's Evas.

569
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
{Shinji}      Nerv...

570
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
{Shinji}      This isn't Nerv, too?

571
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
{Misato}      We are Wille, an organization dedicated to Nerv's destruction.

572
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
{Shinji}      That's...

573
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
{Shinji}      No, but it's being piloted by Ayanami!

574
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
{Misato}      It's not her!

575
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
{Misato}      Rei is gone, Shinji-kun.

576
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
{Shinji}      Liar!

577
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
{Shinji}      I mean, she's right here, isn't she?!

578
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
{Shinji}      You're just daft, Misato-san!

579
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
{Shinji}      I've had enough!

580
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
{Sakura}      Ikari-san!

581
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
{Sakura}      You can go back, but...

582
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
{Sakura}      Please just don't pilot an Eva!

583
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:43,000
{Sakura}      I really do want you to forgive me...

584
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
{Asuka}       Glasses, don't let it get away!

585
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
{Mari}        Loud and clear!

586
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
{Mari}        ♪ When you take aim ♪

587
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
{Mari}        ♪ Be careful not to miss your mark ♪

588
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:02,000
{Mari}        Hey, come on!

589
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:09,000
{Mari}        Alright!

590
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:17,000
{Mari}        I knew it! An Adams' vessel?

591
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
{Mari}        At least say 'hi' or something!

592
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
{Ritsuko}     The fact he was taken in priority over Eva-01

593
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
{Ritsuko}     means he still has potential as a trigger!

594
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:44,000
{Ritsuko}     Misato! Use the DSS choker!

595
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
{Ritsuko}     Mission directive from Executive Officer.

596
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
{Ritsuko}     Pursuit unnecessary.

597
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
{Ritsuko}     All personnel, resume emergency damage control and camouflage operations.

598
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
{Man}         Roger.

599
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
{Man}         Pursuit unnecessary.

600
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
{Asuka}       Hmph.

601
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
{Man}         All personnel, resume emergency damage control and camouflage operation.

602
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
{Asuka}       What do you know.

603
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:16,000
{Asuka}       He's not an idiot, just a brat!

604
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
{Shinji}      I did save her after all.

605
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
{Shinji}      Misato-san is a liar.

606
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:31,000
{Rei}         This way.

607
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:48,000
{Shinji}      Um...

608
00:33:48,000 --> 00:34:00,000
{Shinji}      Even though this is the Geofront, you can see the sky.

609
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
{Shinji}      Is that... Nerv Headquarters?

610
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:36,000
{Shinji}      What happened?

611
00:34:36,000 --> 00:35:15,000
{Shinji}      It really has been fourteen years.

612
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
{Rei}         Here.

613
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
{Shinji}      What's this?

614
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
{Shinji}      An Eva...?

615
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
{Gendo}       That's right.

616
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
{Shinji}      Father...

617
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
{Gendo}       Evangelion 13.

618
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,000
{Gendo}       A unit for you and that pilot.

619
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
{Shinji}      Just now, the piano...

620
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,000
{Gendo}       When the time comes, pilot this Eva along with the boy.

621
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
{Gendo}       We are done talking.

622
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
{Shinji}      Wait a second, Father!

623
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
{Shinji}      I still have a lot of questions, a lot I want to talk about!

624
00:35:53,000 --> 00:36:04,000
{Shinji}      Father!

625
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
{Shinji}      There's no dial tone,

626
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:29,000
{Shinji}      so I can't reach anyone from here.

627
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:42,000
{Shinji}      After all, I must thank her.

628
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
{Shinji}      Ayanami!

629
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
{Shinji}      Ayanami, where are you?

630
00:36:50,000 --> 00:37:26,000
{Shinji}      Ayanami!

631
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
{Shinji}      That's weird, this place is...

632
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
{Shinji}      Ayanami?!

633
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
{Shinji}      There you are!

634
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
{Shinji}      Ayanami!

635
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
{Shinji}      I've been looking for you！

636
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
{Shinji}      Um. Ah, wait!

637
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
{Shinji}      Clothes! Put some clothes on!

638
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
{Rei}         If that is an order, I will do it.

639
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,000
{Shinji}      I'm coming in...

640
00:37:53,000 --> 00:57:59,000
{Shinji}      Um, Ayanami, thank you for this.

641
00:57:59,000 --> 00:38:09,000
{Shinji}      I've been wanting to thank you for a while.

642
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
{Shinji}      Your plugsuit got renewed.

643
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:21,000
{Shinji}      It suits you. Though black is a little...

644
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:28,000
{Shinji}      Nerv HQ has changed quite a lot, hasn't it?

645
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
{Shinji}      Why is Misato-san fighting against Nerv and not the Angels?

646
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
{Shinji}      What does father intend to do here?

647
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
{Shinji}      What's happened to everyone?

648
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
{Shinji}      Hey, Ayanami, do you know anything?

649
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
{Rei}         I do not.

650
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
{Shinji}      I see...

651
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
{Shinji}      Yeah, you may be right.

652
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:59,000
{Shinji}      Say, when did you return from Eva-01?

653
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
{Shinji}      This place isn't much of a room.

654
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
{Shinji}      You could say it's just your style,

655
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
{Shinji}      but it doesn't seem like there is school, so what do you do all the time?

656
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
{Rei}         Wait. For orders.

657
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
{Shinji}      There are no books here.

658
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
{Shinji}      You're not reading any books?

659
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
{Rei}         Books?

660
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
{Rei}         If I were Ayanami Rei, would I read books?

661
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
{Shinji}      Yeah. You read a lot, didn't you?

662
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
{Shinji}      There were books in your room, too.

663
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
{Rei}         I see...

664
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
{Shinji}      I got it!

665
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
{Shinji}      I'll go look in the library here and bring you some.

666
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
{Shinji}      Um, English books are good, right?

667
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
{Shinji}      You always had one on you, so I guess you liked them.

668
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
{Rei}         "Liked"...?

669
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
{Shinji}      Yeah... At least, I think so.

670
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:56,000
{Rei}         What is "liked"?

671
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
{Fuyutsuki}   So Seele are still maintaining their silence?

672
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
{Gendo}       The Human Instrumentality Project will be carried out according to the Dead Sea Scrolls.

673
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
{Gendo}       We no longer need to weave the story.

674
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:15,000
{Fuyutsuki}   Ikari, you intend to use Eva-13 this time?

675
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:21,000
{Fuyutsuki}   No matter. I will go along with your plan.

676
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
{Fuyutsuki}   For Yui-kun's sake.

677
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:35,000
{Shinji}      It's no use. It doesn't work.

678
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
{Misato}      Don't do anything.

679
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
{Asuka}       None of your business.

680
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
{Sakura}      Please, just don't pilot an Eva!

681
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
{Gendo}       Pilot the Eva.

682
00:40:41,000 --> 00:41:37,000
{Rei}         I don't know.

683
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
{Kaworu}      Come down here, Ikari-kun.

684
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:46,000
{Kaworu}      Let's talk!

685
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
{Shinji}      U-Uh, aren't we going to talk?

686
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
{Kaworu}      A piano duet is a dialogue of sounds, you could say.

687
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
{Kaworu}      Why don't we try it?

688
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
{Shinji}      No, that's alright. I can't play.

689
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:08,000
{Kaworu}      If you want to live well, you have to change and try new things.

690
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
{Kaworu}      Look, it's easy.

691
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:27,000
{Kaworu}      You just have to hit this key here.

692
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:53,000
{Kaworu}      Now, follow along with me.

693
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
{Kaworu}      Very good!

694
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:32,000
{Kaworu}      You're playing so well.

695
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
{Kaworu}      Every note is a joy.

696
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:42,000
{Kaworu}      We're amazing together, aren't we?

697
00:43:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
{Shinji}      Thanks.

698
00:44:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
{Shinji}      It's been ages since I've had this much fun.

699
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
{Kaworu}      Same here.

700
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
{Kaworu}      We'll have to do this again.

701
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
{Kaworu}      You can come anytime, Ikari Shinji-kun.

702
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
{Shinji}      Sure.

703
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
{Shinji}      Oh, you are...?

704
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
{Kaworu}      I'm Kaworu, Nagisa Kaworu.

705
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:08,000
{Kaworu}      I'm a child chosen by fate, the same as you.

706
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
{Shinji}      She's not here this time, either.

707
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:29,000
{Shinji}      The books haven't been touched, either.

708
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
{Kaworu}      Good morning, Ikari Shinji-kun.

709
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
{Kaworu}      You're here early today.

710
00:44:35,000 --> 00:45:07,000
{Shinji}      I don't really have anything else to do.

711
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
{Shinji}      I wonder how I could play it better...

712
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
{Kaworu}      You don't need to be good at playing it.

713
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
{Kaworu}      Just producing a pleasing sound will suffice.

714
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
{Shinji}      So if I want to improve the sound I'm making, what should I do?

715
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
{Kaworu}      It takes repeated practice.

716
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:30,000
{Kaworu}      Doing it over and over until it feels good enough to you.

717
00:45:30,000 --> 00:46:02,000
{Kaworu}      That's the only way.

718
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
{Kaworu}      It's okay, leave it to me.

719
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
{Kaworu}      You just need it to work, right?

720
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
{Shinji}      Hm, thank you.

721
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
{Shinji}      I feel bad for making you do so much for me.

722
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
{Kaworu}      You don't need to worry about that.

723
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:18,000
{Kaworu}      We're friends, after all.

724
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
{Kaworu}      It's gotten quite dark, hasn't it?

725
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
{Kaworu}      Why don't we head back for today?

726
00:46:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
{Shinji}      Hey, why don't we stay here for a little longer?

727
00:45:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
{Shinji}      We could watch the stars from here.

728
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
{Kaworu}      The stars?

729
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
{Kaworu}      Do you like the stars?

730
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
{Shinji}      Yeah.

731
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
{Shinji}      It's always struck me how large the universe is.

732
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,000
{Shinji}      There's something about it that's put my mind completely at ease, ever since I was little.

733
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,000
{Shinji}      I guess I'm glad that it hasn't changed at all these past fourteen years.

734
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:55,000
{Shinji}      It calms me down, if that makes sense.

735
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
{Shinji}      Uh, it's hard to put into words.

736
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
{Kaworu}      Your feelings came through.

737
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,000
{Kaworu}      Instead of seeking change, you prefer a world of nothingness and brutal abyss.

738
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
{Kaworu}      It's like you.

739
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
{Kaworu}      Lying here together is nice.

740
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
{Kaworu}      I didn't know it could be so pleasant.

741
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
{Kaworu}      Thanks for inviting me.

742
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
{Shinji}      No, you don't need to.

743
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:27,000
{Shinji}      I just thought that it'd be fun, if you wanted to try it, and...

744
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
{Kaworu}      It is fun.

745
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:44,000
{Kaworu}      I really was born to meet you.

746
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:50,000
{Shinji}      Hm?

747
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
{Shinji}      Seems a little big this time.

748
00:47:53,000 --> 00:48:00,000
{Shinji}      Huh?

749
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
{Kaworu}      Here, it should work now.

750
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
{Shinji}      Thanks.

751
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
{Shinji}      You're amazing, Nagisa-kun.

752
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
{Shinji}      You can do everything.

753
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
{Kaworu}      This is just knowledge.

754
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
{Kaworu}      It's because I've stayed in this world for a little longer than you.

755
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
{Shinji}      Still... you're amazing.

756
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
{Kaworu}      You don't look too well.

757
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,000
{Kaworu}      What's wrong?

758
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
{Shinji}      I'm worried about my friends.

759
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
{Kaworu}      Friends?

760
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
{Shinji}      Yeah.

761
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
{Shinji}      There was a city above Nerv HQ.

762
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
{Shinji}      That's where everyone lived.

763
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
{Shinji}      Toji, Kensuke, Prez,

764
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
{Shinji}      the rest of the class...

765
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
{Shinji}      Apparently I'd been sleeping in Eva-01 for fourteen years.

766
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:50,000
{Shinji}      I don't know what's changed in that time.

767
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
{Kaworu}      Not knowing the answer to that must be painful.

768
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
{Shinji}      Somehow, I'm scared.

769
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:02,000
{Shinji}      Of what's happened to the city and everybody...

770
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
{Shinji}      I'm scared of it for some reason.

771
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:15,000
{Shinji}      That's right, I'm scared!

772
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:44,000
{Kaworu}      Do you want to know?

773
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
{Shinji}      Nagisa-kun?

774
00:49:46,000 --> 00:50:03,000
{Shinji}      Nagisa-kun!

775
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:22,000
{Kaworu}      Just a little longer now.

776
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
{Kaworu}      The clouds will disperse soon,

777
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:36,000
{Kaworu}      and you will see the truth you desire.

778
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:42,000
{Shinji}      What is this...?

779
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:51,000
{Kaworu}      The outcome of Third Impact, which came to pass while you were merged with Eva-01.

780
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
{Shinji}      But this is...

781
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
{Shinji}      What happened to everyone in the city?

782
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
{Kaworu}      Mass extinction is not unusual on this planet.

783
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,000
{Kaworu}      Rather, it is the aspect that drives evolution.

784
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:08,000
{Kaworu}      Because life is fundamentally something that adjusts to the world and changes itself.

785
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:15,000
{Kaworu}      However, Lilin do not change themselves, but the world.

786
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:21,000
{Kaworu}      So they brought the rite of artificial evolution unto themselves.

787
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
{Kaworu}      Old life is offered in sacrifice,

788
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:29,000
{Kaworu}      so that new beings blessed with the Fruit of Life may be created.

789
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,000
{Kaworu}      All this is due to the death instinct that's been programmed since time immemorial.

790
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,000
{Kaworu}      Nerv call it the Human Instrumentality Project.

791
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,000
{Shinji}      This is Nerv's...

792
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:48,000
{Shinji}      This is what my father was doing.

793
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
{Kaworu}      Ikari Shinji-kun,

794
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,000
{Kaworu}      once Awakened, Eva-01 opened the Door of Guf

795
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
{Kaworu}      and became the trigger for Third Impact.

796
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,000
{Kaworu}      Lilin call it Near Third Impact.

797
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:09,000
{Kaworu}      It was all initiated by you.

798
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
{Shinji}      You're wrong!

799
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:16,000
{Shinji}      All I did was save Ayanami!

800
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:21,000
{Kaworu}      True, but that was the catalyst...

801
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,000
{Shinji}      All this...

802
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
{Shinji}      I didn't know!

803
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
{Shinji}      You're telling me all of this so fast,

804
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
{Shinji}      and there's nothing I can do about it!

805
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
{Kaworu}      Indeed.

806
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,000
{Kaworu}      There's nothing you can do about your past.

807
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
{Kaworu}      The truth you desired to know.

808
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,000
{Kaworu}      The Lilin are providing you reparation for your sin as a result.

809
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:48,000
{Kaworu}      That's what your neck device is, no?

810
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
{Shinji}      What sin?

811
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
{Shinji}      I didn't do anything!

812
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
{Shinji}      I had nothing to do with it!

813
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,000
{Kaworu}      If it wasn't you, then who was it?

814
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,000
{Kaworu}      However, no sin is beyond redemption.

815
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
{Kaworu}      There is always hope.

816
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:23,000
{Kaworu}      Always.

817
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,000
{Fuyutsuki}   Seele's boy has contacted the Third Boy.

818
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
{Fuyutsuki}   He showed him the conditions outside, it seems.

819
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
{Fuyutsuki}   Was his reaction as you anticipated?

820
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
{Fuyutsuki}   Are you okay with all of this, Ikari?

821
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,000
{Gendo}       Seele's scenario is being rewritten by us.

822
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
{Gendo}       All existence is nothing more than a tool to that end.

823
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:48,000
{Fuyutsuki}   You assume that your son wouldn't benefit even from seeing how you live?

824
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:53,000
{Fuyutsuki}   I don't agree with that.

825
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
{Shinji}      What is...

826
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:03,000
{Shinji}      What am I supposed--

827
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
{Shinji}      Right... I saved Ayanami.

828
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:32,000
{Shinji}      Wasn't that the right thing?

829
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
{Shinji}      She's gone again.

830
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,000
{Shinji}      She still hasn't touched the books.

831
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
{Shinji}      What's going on...?

832
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:53,000
{Shinji}      What's wrong with Ayanami?!

833
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,000
{Fuyutsuki}   Third Boy, do you play shogi?

834
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
{Shinji}      Eh... I only sort of know the rules.

835
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
{Fuyutsuki}   That's fine. Choose a side.

836
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:12,000
{Fuyutsuki}   I'll start without a castle, bishop, and golden general.

837
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
{Fuyutsuki}   Let your mind be still.

838
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
{Fuyutsuki}   It's the only way to achieve victory.

839
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:24,000
{Fuyutsuki}   You'll lose in another thirty-one turns.

840
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:31,000
{Fuyutsuki}   Hmm...

841
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,000
{Fuyutsuki}   Is it more fun for you this way?

842
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:43,000
{Fuyutsuki}   Thank you for indulging an old man his hobby.

843
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
{Fuyutsuki}   I'm a coward too, you know.

844
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:50,000
{Fuyutsuki}   I used this game as a pretext to talk to you.

845
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,000
{Fuyutsuki}   Do you remember your mother?

846
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,000
{Shinji}      No. I was too small.

847
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:07,000
{Shinji}      Father got rid of everything that was hers.

848
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,000
{Shinji}      Is this...

849
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
{Shinji}      Ayanami?

850
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
{Fuyutsuki}   Your mother.

851
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
{Fuyutsuki}   Maiden name, Ayanami Yui.

852
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,000
{Fuyutsuki}   She was my student at the university.

853
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:27,000
{Fuyutsuki}   Now, she is the control system of Eva Unit 01.

854
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:33,000
{Fuyutsuki}   Hm. The power was finally restored.

855
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,000
{Fuyutsuki}   The control system from very early in the Evas' development.

856
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,000
{Fuyutsuki}   Here, Yui-kun proposed direct entry into cores,

857
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,000
{Fuyutsuki}   and tested it with herself as the experimentee.

858
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:55,000
{Fuyutsuki}   You were watching, too. Your memory must have been erased.

859
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,000
{Fuyutsuki}   The result was that Yui-kun vanished here,

860
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,000
{Fuyutsuki}   and only her data was recovered, in the Ayanami Series.

861
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:08,000
{Fuyutsuki}   The Rei you know is one of Yui-kun's clones.

862
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:13,000
{Fuyutsuki}   She is preserved within Eva-01, the same as your mother.

863
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,000
{Fuyutsuki}   All of it is Ikari's plan.

864
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
{Shinji}      No way...

865
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
{Fuyutsuki}   Breaking the world is not difficult.

866
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
{Fuyutsuki}   But rebuilding it, that isn't so easy.

867
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,000
{Fuyutsuki}   The world can be reversed no more than time.

868
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
{Fuyutsuki}   Nor even the human heart...

869
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
{Fuyutsuki}   And thus, so that his wish might be granted,

870
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
{Fuyutsuki}   Ikari is paying every price there is.

871
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
{Fuyutsuki}   Even his very soul.

872
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
{Fuyutsuki}   I've imparted to you a little of the truth.

873
00:57:47,000 --> 00:58:01,000
{Fuyutsuki}   About your father, as well...

874
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
{Fuyutsuki}   I could have been given a more pleasant part to play.

875
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:15,000
{Fuyutsuki}   Yui-kun, this should do.

876
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:20,000
{Gendo}       The time of the final contract is upon us.

877
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:31,000
{Gendo}       We shall soon meet, Yui.

878
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:36,000
{Shinji}      Why aren't you reading the books?

879
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
{Rei}         That wasn't your order.

880
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
{Shinji}      "Order"...?

881
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:45,000
{Shinji}      Alright, that's enough!

882
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
{Shinji}      Are you still Ayanami...?

883
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
{Rei}         Yes, Ayanami Rei.

884
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,000
{Shinji}      Then I did save you, right...?

885
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:04,000
{Rei}         ...I don't know.

886
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:11,000
{Rei}         Ikari-kun...?

887
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,000
{Shinji}      So, I didn't actually save her...

888
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
{Shinji}      Ayanami...

889
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:21,000
{Misato}      Don't do anything.

890
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:21,000
{Rei}         I don't know.

891
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
{Asuka}       None of your business.

892
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,000
{Gendo}       Pilot the Eva.

893
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
{Sakura}      Whatever you do, don't pilot an Eva!

894
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,000
{Misato}      Don't do anything.

895
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
{Asuka}       None of your business.

896
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
{Gendo}       Pilot the Eva.

897
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
{Asuka}       None of your business.

898
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,000
{Sakura}      Whatever you do, don't pilot an Eva!

899
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
{Shinji}      Father...

900
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
{Rei}         I don't know.

901
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
{Misato}      Don't do anything.

902
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
{Gendo}       Pilot the Eva.

903
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
{Asuka}       None of your business.

904
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
{Sakura}      Whatever you do, don't pilot an Eva!

905
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
{Misato}      Don't do anything.

906
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:46,000
{Gendo}       Pilot the Eva.

907
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
{Asuka}       None of your business.

908
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:48,000
{Misato}      Don't do anything.

909
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
{Rei}         I don't know.

910
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
{Asuka}       None of your business.

911
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
{Gendo}       Pilot the Eva.

912
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
{Misato}      Don't do anything.

913
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:53,000
{Rei}         I don't know.

914
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
{Asuka}       ...your business.

915
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
{Rei}         I don't know.

916
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
{Asuka}       None of your business.

917
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
{Sakura}      Whatever you do, don't pilot an Eva!

918
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
{Rei}         I don't know.

919
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:08,000
{Gendo}       Pilot the Eva.

920
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:47,000
{Shinji}      What did I do?

921
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,000
{Fuyutsuki}   Has the final executor been completed?

922
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:56,000
{Gendo}       Yes, everything we need is right here.

923
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,000
{Kaworu}      The time has come.

924
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,000
{Kaworu}      This is it, Ikari Shinji-kun.

925
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,000
{Shinji}      No!

926
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
{Shinji}      I don't want to pilot an Eva anymore!

927
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
{Shinji}      I didn't save Ayanami after all!

928
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
{Shinji}      Nothing good came out of me piloting the Eva!

929
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,000
{Shinji}      I've had enough! I don't want to do anything!

930
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:24,000
{Kaworu}      And so, the refrain of bitter memories will keep good things from happening.

931
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
{Shinji}      Nothing is ever good!

932
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,000
{Shinji}      You were the one who showed me that, Kaworu.

933
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
{Shinji}      A world where I can't do anything!

934
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:37,000
{Kaworu}      That which was changed by Eva can be changed back by Eva in turn.

935
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
{Shinji}      You say that, but my father, Eva, Misato-san...

936
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:43,000
{Shinji}      I can't believe in anyone, or anything!

937
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
{Kaworu}      Still, I want you to believe in me.

938
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,000
{Shinji}      I can't!

939
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,000
{Shinji}      Misato-san put this thing on me!

940
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
{Shinji}      They said to never pilot Eva again.

941
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,000
{Shinji}      They said if I pilot, I'll die.

942
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:09,000
{Shinji}      I don't care about Eva anymore.

943
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
{Kaworu}      I understand.

944
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:21,000
{Kaworu}      I will shoulder the burden of the Lilin's curse, and the risk of Eva's Awakening, for you.

945
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
{Shinji}      Nagisa-kun...

946
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
{Kaworu}      You don't have to worry.

947
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
{Kaworu}      Because I was originally something created by the very Lilin who fear me.

948
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:34,000
{Kaworu}      I had intended to do this at some stage.

949
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:41,000
{Kaworu}      Ikari Shinji-kun, your only hope lies with the two Spears left at the Impact epicenter in Dogma.

950
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:45,000
{Kaworu}      They are the key to activating Instrumentality.

951
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
{Kaworu}      All we have to do is obtain those Spears.

952
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,000
{Kaworu}      If we do that, Nerv will not be able to cause Fourth Impact.

953
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:58,000
{Kaworu}      And if we use them together with Eva-13, it becomes possible to fix the world.

954
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:03,000
{Shinji}      You're right.

955
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
{Shinji}      Yes. It is possible for you.

956
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
{Kaworu}      It is possible WITH you.

957
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:11,000
{Kaworu}      Eva-13 uses a double entry system.

958
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:15,000
{Kaworu}      Let the two of us become the hope of the Lilin.

959
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,000
{Kaworu}      Because what you need the most right now is hope,

960
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:25,000
{Kaworu}      along with atonement and an open heart.

961
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:30,000
{Shinji}      You're amazing. You know everything.

962
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:35,000
{Kaworu}      That's because I am always thinking about you.

963
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,000
{Shinji}      Thank you, Nagisa-kun.

964
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
{Kaworu}      "Kaworu" is fine.

965
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,000
{Shinji}      Ah, okay.

966
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:49,000
{Shinji}      "Shinji" is fine for me, too.

967
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
{Kaworu}      It is the same as playing piano.

968
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:56,000
{Kaworu}      Good things will come if we do it together.

969
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:38,000
{Shinji}      Let's go, Kaworu-kun.

970
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:43,000
{Both}        Evangelion 13, start up!

971
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
{Aoba}        Incoming signal!

972
01:04:44,000 --> 01:05:06,000
{Aoba}        Activation of a new type of Eva confirmed.

973
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
{Shinji}      We're not alone.

974
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:08,000
{Kaworu}      You mean the Mark.09?

975
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
{Kaworu}      It's here as our backup.

976
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,000
{Kaworu}      It will warn us of any Wille activity.

977
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
{Shinji}      The two of us should be enough for all that.

978
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,000
{Shinji}      She isn't even Ayanami...

979
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:28,000
{Rei}         Not... Ayanami?

980
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
{Shinji}      The walls...?

981
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:38,000
{Kaworu}      Yes, all of the failures of infinity.

982
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,000
{Kaworu}      Don't let them weigh upon your mind.

983
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
{Kaworu}      We're nearly at Lilith's barrier.

984
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
{Kaworu}      The Main Shaft is completely blocked,

985
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:56,000
{Kaworu}      keeping anyone from intruding over the past fourteen years.

986
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,000
{Shinji}      It's like one big lid.

987
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,000
{Kaworu}      It's all right. Eva-13 was made for breaking through this.

988
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:15,000
{Kaworu}      The two of us can do it.

989
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
{Kaworu}      Try to join tempos.

990
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:24,000
{Kaworu}      Remember the piano duet.

991
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:48,000
{Kaworu}      Let's go, Shinji-kun.

992
01:06:48,000 --> 01:07:07,000
{Shinji}      We did it!

993
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:14,000
{Kaworu}      We've arrived. The deepest part of Central Dogma.

994
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:21,000
{Kaworu}      The epicenter of Third Impact.

995
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
{Shinji}      Is this Lilith?

996
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
{Kaworu}      It once was.

997
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
{Kaworu}      Now, it is her corpse.

998
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:32,000
{Shinji}      Misato-san, even though we tried to protect it with our lives...

999
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,000
{Shinji}      Uh... That's an Eva?

1000
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,000
{Kaworu}      Yes, the Eva Mark.06.

1001
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
{Kaworu}      Remodeled into an autonomous type,

1002
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:48,000
{Kaworu}      exploitation by the Lilin brought the unit to a state of ruin.

1003
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,000
{Shinji}      The things that are piercing them... are our targets?

1004
01:07:52,000 --> 01:08:00,000
{Kaworu}      Yes, the Spears of Longinus and Cassius. Wielding both requires two souls.

1005
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,000
{Kaworu}      That is why we have the Double Entry System.

1006
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,000
{Shinji}      Then... wouldn't THAT pilot have been just as good for this as me?

1007
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
{Kaworu}      No, a Lilin imitation cannot be used.

1008
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,000
{Kaworu}      Their souls' placement is different.

1009
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:23,000
{Kaworu}      Well, let's begin.

1010
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
{Kaworu}      Hold on.

1011
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,000
{Kaworu}      Something is wrong.

1012
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:31,000
{Shinji}      What is it, Kaworu-kun?

1013
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
{Kaworu}      This is not right...

1014
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,000
{Kaworu}      Both of the Spears have changed to a similar shape.

1015
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
{Shinji}      Let's just pull the Spears quickly!

1016
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:44,000
{Shinji}      That's why we came here in this Eva.

1017
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:55,000
{Shinji}      What's going on?!

1018
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
{Shinji}      Eva-02?

1019
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
{Shinji}      Asuka!

1020
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:05,000
{Shinji}      What are you doing, Asuka?!

1021
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
{Asuka}       Stupid Shinji?!

1022
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
{Asuka}       You can't seriously be piloting an Eva?

1023
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
{Shinji}      I am.

1024
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
{Shinji}      I'm going to change the world with this Eva!

1025
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
{Asuka}       You little brat...

1026
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:25,000
{Asuka}       If that's how it is, don't pilot!

1027
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
{Asuka}       Support fire, you're always late!

1028
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
{Mari}        Sorry, sorry!

1029
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,000
{Mari}        Adams' Vessel-san,

1030
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:54,000
{Mari}        stay confined, at least...

1031
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
{Shinji}      Why are you interfering, Asuka?

1032
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:01,000
{Shinji}      Are those our Spears of Hope?!

1033
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,000
{Asuka}       Stop!... looking!... for trouble!

1034
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
{Asuka}       You brat, Shinji!

1035
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
{Asuka}       Are you planning to start Third Impact again?

1036
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
{Shinji}      You're wrong!

1037
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,000
{Shinji}      I'm trying to fix everything!

1038
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,000
{Shinji}      I'm trying to save the world!

1039
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,000
{Asuka}       You really are a little twerp.

1040
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:30,000
{Shinji}      You just don't get it!

1041
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,000
{Shinji}      Kaworu-kun, why aren't you helping?

1042
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:39,000
{Kaworu}      Cassius and Longinus. Both of the Spears are needed...

1043
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:43,000
{Kaworu}      But the only two Spears that are here are the same...

1044
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
{Shinji}      Kaworu-kun!

1045
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
{Kaworu}      That's it!

1046
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
{Kaworu}      Now I understand,

1047
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:55,000
{Kaworu}      Lilin!

1048
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,000
{Mari}        Hey, Seele temp pilot,

1049
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
{Mari}        you can hear me, right?

1050
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,000
{Mari}        Don't you think you should get out before you turn into an Adams' Vessel?

1051
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
{Rei}         No. That is not the order I received.

1052
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
{Mari}        Talk about a square.

1053
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,000
{Mari}        You know your original was a whole lot more friendly?

1054
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
{Rei}         Original?

1055
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:30,000
{Rei}         The other me...

1056
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:45,000
{Shinji}      Kaworu-kun? What's the matter?

1057
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,000
{Shinji}      Asuka...

1058
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,000
{Shinji}      Please! Stay out of our way!

1059
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:57,000
{Asuka}       Go down quietly, you little brat!

1060
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
{Asuka}       Of all times!

1061
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:07,000
{Asuka}       Hey, Glasses! I need a spare!

1062
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:11,000
{Shinji}      While we still have the chance! The Spears!

1063
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
{Asuka}       You'd raise a hand against a girl...

1064
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
{Asuka}       You're the worst.

1065
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:28,000
{Mari}        Spare, incoming!

1066
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
{Kaworu}      Let's stop, Shinji-kun.

1067
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
{Kaworu}      I have a bad feeling about this...

1068
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
{Shinji}      We can't, Kaworu-kun!

1069
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,000
{Shinji}      We came here to do something!

1070
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
{Kaworu}      We've done enough!

1071
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,000
{Kaworu}      These aren't the Spears we came for!

1072
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:47,000
{Shinji}      Not... the Spears we came for...

1073
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,000
{Shinji}      You're the one who said we need the Spears.

1074
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:57,000
{Shinji}      That's why I got into this Eva!

1075
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:02,000
{Kaworu}      The control system...?

1076
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,000
{Shinji}      For Kaworu-kun,

1077
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
{Shinji}      for everyone, I will get the Spears!

1078
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:11,000
{Shinji}      Only then will the world go back to the way it should be.

1079
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:15,000
{Shinji}      If I do that, even Misato-san will...

1080
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
{Asuka}       Damn!

1081
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
{Asuka}       Glasses! Get rid of the barrier!

1082
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
{Asuka}       You're cleared to use AA ammo!

1083
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
{Mari}        I've been waiting for this.

1084
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:30,000
{Mari}        Check these babies out!

1085
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
{Mari}        No A.T. Field?

1086
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:46,000
{Mari}        Don't tell me this unit...

1087
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
{Kaworu}      Don't do it, Shinji-kun!

1088
01:13:48,000 --> 01:14:13,000
{Asuka}       Stop, you stupid brat!

1089
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:22,000
{Gendo}       Let's begin, Fuyutsuki.

1090
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,000
{Shinji}      Eva Mark.06?

1091
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,000
{Shinji}      Pattern blue?

1092
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:30,000
{Shinji}      What's going on?

1093
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
{Asuka}       This is bad!

1094
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,000
{Asuka}       The Twelfth Angel is still alive!

1095
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
{Asuka}       Glasses, Container No.3!

1096
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
{Mari}        Got it!

1097
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:49,000
{Asuka}       I'll deal with this before Third Impact starts up again!

1098
01:14:49,000 --> 01:15:00,000
{Rei}         It was on orders.

1099
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:10,000
{Shinji}      An Angel?!

1100
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,000
{Mari}        Princess, you should cease the futile fire.

1101
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,000
{Mari}        The whole thing is a core.

1102
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:21,000
{Mari}        With just us, there's no way to hurt it.

1103
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,000
{Mari}        Besides that, by defeating the Last Angel,

1104
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
{Mari}        we don't know what kind of evil will come out.

1105
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:32,000
{Mari}        You're worried, no?

1106
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:37,000
{Rei}         This is...

1107
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:41,000
{Rei}         This is... me?

1108
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:46,000
{Rei}         What am I...?

1109
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
{Shinji}      The controls aren't responding.

1110
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:51,000
{Shinji}      What's going on, Kaworu-kun?

1111
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
{Shinji}      Kaworu-kun!

1112
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,000
{Kaworu}      I never imagined that I, the First Angel,

1113
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:00,000
{Kaworu}      would be cast down to the Thirteenth.

1114
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,000
{Shinji}      What are you doing, Kaworu-kun?

1115
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:08,000
{Kaworu}      So the beginning and the end are the same.

1116
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,000
{Kaworu}      I'd expect as much from the King of the Lilin,

1117
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
{Kaworu}      Shinji-kun's father!

1118
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
{Mari}        DSS Choker, pattern blue?

1119
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:19,000
{Mari}        A Thirteenth? Even though the Twelfth should've been the last?!

1120
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:24,000
{Mari}        So this is what Gendo-kun is aiming for.

1121
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:29,000
{Gendo}       It is time to amend the Dead Sea Scrolls' contract.

1122
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:33,000
{Gendo}       This is farewell.

1123
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:37,000
{Gendo}       Even though all of you have changed the shape of your souls,

1124
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:41,000
{Gendo}       you are still lifeforms blessed with the Fruit of Knowledge.

1125
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:44,000
{Gendo}       You were able to live for eternity,

1126
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:50,000
{Gendo}       but, same as us, you still cannot escape the fate of death.

1127
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,000
{Gendo}       To advance the evolution of the flock burdened with death,

1128
01:16:54,000 --> 01:17:00,000
{Gendo}       you had bestowed upon us the gift of civilization.

1129
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,000
{Gendo}       As the representative of humanity, I say thank you.

1130
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:12,000
{Gendo}       Through death, I shall return your souls to where they belong.

1131
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,000
{Gendo}       The long desired Human Instrumentality Project,

1132
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:19,000
{Gendo}       and the contracted deicide, will be completed by me.

1133
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
{Gendo}       Rest assured.

1134
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:25,000
{Keel}        Our wishes have come to fruition.

1135
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,000
{Keel}        Good.

1136
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,000
{Keel}        Everything is good.

1137
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
{Keel}        Human Instrumentality.

1138
01:17:31,000 --> 01:18:06,000
{Keel}        We hope for the peaceful purification of all souls.

1139
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
{Asuka}       Damn it!

1140
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
{Asuka}       It's entering its pseudo-evolved form!

1141
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,000
{Mari}        Guess it's Awakening...

1142
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:49,000
{Mari}        It's one of the surviving Adams!

1143
01:18:49,000 --> 01:19:04,000
{Shinji}      What's this...?

1144
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:11,000
{Shinji}      What IS this...?

1145
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,000
{Shinji}      It's all my fault!

1146
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:22,000
{Shinji}      Because I pulled the Spears!

1147
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
{Shinji}      This is...!

1148
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,000
{Kaworu}      Fourth Impact...

1149
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:45,000
{Kaworu}      These are the opening ceremonies.

1150
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,000
{Shinji}      Kaworu-kun...

1151
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:55,000
{Shinji}      The choker!

1152
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:59,000
{Shinji}      Misato-san?!

1153
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
{Misato}      A.T. Field at maximum!

1154
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
{Misato}      Contain the Eva in its present state!

1155
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,000
{Misato}      Principal weapon prepared! Charged with howitzer!

1156
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
{Misato}      Do whatever it takes to keep Fourth Impact in check!

1157
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:17,000
{Misato}      Fire!

1158
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
{Midori}      Damage received! Direct hit to main armament!

1159
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:26,000
{Misato}      The Adams' Vessel?!

1160
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
{Tama}        Shots received on midsection! Damage unknown!

1161
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
{Woman (BG)}  / The target is the new-type Eva! ＃＃＃＃

1162
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
{Sumire}      Rudder is ineffective!

1163
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:43,000
{Sumire}      We're losing altitude!

1164
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,000
{Tama}        / 中＃＃＃＃＃＃！

1165
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
{Ritsuko}     The Adams' Vessel... Wunder's original master!

1166
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:57,000
{Ritsuko}     It intends to take the ship's controls back from Eva-01!

1167
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:05,000
{Rei}         Why can't I restore the link?

1168
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
{Mari}        Oh, man!

1169
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,000
{Mari}        These guys are not messing around.

1170
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
{Asuka}       Glasses, you handle the brat's Eva!

1171
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
{Asuka}       I'll help out Wunder with 02'!

1172
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,000
{Mari}        Roger!

1173
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
{Midori}      Unable to reject the Adams' Vessel!

1174
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
{Tama}        Unidentified data is infiltrating the main control system!

1175
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:43,000
{Aoba}        It is hijacking control of the ship!

1176
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:53,000
{Asuka}       Talk about cheap! That's Seele's style, all right.

1177
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
{Asuka}       Mode change!

1178
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:04,000
{Asuka}       Code 777 (Triple Seven)!

1179
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,000
{Rei}         Who's there?

1180
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:24,000
{Asuka}       Who the hell are YOU?!

1181
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
{Aoba}        Report from lower bridge.

1182
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,000
{Aoba}        Eva-02' has engaged the Adams' Vessel!

1183
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:48,000
{Misato}      We're counting on you, Asuka.

1184
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,000
{Rei}         If I were Ayanami Rei, what would I do at a time like this?

1185
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:58,000
{Asuka}       Hell if I know!

1186
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:09,000
{Asuka}       Do whatever you want!

1187
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:12,000
{Asuka}       Geez! The whole thing's a core?

1188
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
{Asuka}       No time...

1189
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:31,000
{Asuka}       Sorry, Eva-02!

1190
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
{Sumire}      Control systems restored!

1191
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,000
{Misato}      Emergency launch of all ships!

1192
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
{Misato}      Pursue the target Eva immediately!

1193
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:40,000
{Ritsuko}     Captain, it won't be possible until the main unit is restored!

1194
01:23:40,000 --> 01:24:02,000
{Misato}      Shinji-kun...

1195
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:06,000
{Shinji}      This is all because of me...

1196
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:12,000
{Shinji}      I...

1197
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,000
{Kaworu}      It's not your fault.

1198
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:19,000
{Kaworu}      It's because I became the Thirteenth Angel.

1199
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
{Kaworu}      I'm the trigger.

1200
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,000
{Shinji}      What do I do?

1201
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:31,000
{Shinji}      Hey, what are we going to do?

1202
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,000
{Shinji}      Kaworu-kun,

1203
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,000
{Shinji}      tell me what the right thing would be.

1204
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:43,000
{Kaworu}      Even if souls disappear, hopes and curses will remain in this world.

1205
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:48,000
{Kaworu}      Intent is imparted to the world as information and goes on to change.

1206
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:54,000
{Kaworu}      In time, even one's very self is being rewritten.

1207
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:59,000
{Kaworu}      I'm sorry. This isn't the happiness you wished for.

1208
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:03,000
{Kaworu}      I will close the Door of Guf.

1209
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
{Kaworu}      You don't need to worry about it, Shinji-kun.

1210
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,000
{Shinji}      Kaworu-kun...

1211
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,000
{Shinji}      What are you saying, Kaworu-kun?

1212
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:18,000
{Shinji}      I don't get any of it!

1213
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:31,000
{Kaworu}      Shinji-kun, you should find a place of peace and self.

1214
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:37,000
{Kaworu}      Fate will surely guide you.

1215
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:41,000
{Kaworu}      Don't make that face.

1216
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,000
{Kaworu}      We'll meet again, Shinji-kun.

1217
01:25:44,000 --> 01:26:04,000
{Shinji}      Kaworu-kun!

1218
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
{Mari}        The Door of Guf hasn't closed yet?

1219
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:25,000
{Mari}        So, Puppy Boy is Seele's backup measure!

1220
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,000
{Mari}        I'm done cleaning up!

1221
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,000
{Mari}        Hang in there, Puppy Boy!

1222
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,000
{Mari}        Don't be such a baby!

1223
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
{Mari}        Help out the Princess, at least!

1224
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,000
{Mari}        Be a man!

1225
01:26:36,000 --> 01:27:33,000
{Mari}        And while you're at it, get to know the world a little!

1226
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
{Fuyutsuki}   What a nightmare.

1227
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:38,000
{Fuyutsuki}   Nearly all went as Seele intended.

1228
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:46,000
{Gendo}       But not only was Seele's boy eliminated, the path was forged for Eva-13's Awakening.

1229
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,000
{Gendo}       Captain Katsuragi's actions are within predictions, as well.

1230
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:52,000
{Gendo}       This will do for now.

1231
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,000
{Hyuga}       All ships, maintain organization for Class 2 withdrawal.

1232
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
{Woman}       No pattern blue readings.

1233
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
{Woman}       No ships sighted in withdrawal airspace.

1234
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
{Man}         Damaged areas of the midsection have received emergency treatment.

1235
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:04,000
{Ritsuko}     Fourth Impact was stopped, but we don't know whom to thank.

1236
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
{Man (BG)}    / ＃んざい不明＃＃のは水中。（BGの男オペレター）

1237
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,000
{Man (BG)}    / じごくは不明、とっか、じんき回収＃＃＃＃。

1238
01:28:07,000 --> 01:29:01,000
{Ritsuko}     Misato, let's leave it for now...

1239
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:04,000
{Asuka}       You brat, Shinji.

1240
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:10,000
{Asuka}       You didn't come to help me?

1241
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
{Asuka}       Yet again, it's all about you.

1242
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:40,000
{Asuka}       You think you can just get away with what's happened by not saying a thing.

1243
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,000
{Asuka}       You still need pampering?

1244
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:47,000
{Asuka}       No matter how much time passes... you're always such a brat!

1245
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:50,000
{Asuka}       Here, put this on.

1246
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:58,000
{Asuka}       Jeez! You can stand on your own, can't you?!

1247
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:02,000
{Asuka}       The pilot from earlier.

1248
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:11,000
{Asuka}       From an early lot of Ayanami Types?

1249
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:16,000
{Asuka}       The L Barrier's density is too strong here, so they won't come to help us.

1250
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:23,000
{Asuka}       We're going to where the Lilin are.

1251
01:30:23,000 --> 01:35:10,000
{Asuka}       Come on!

1252
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
{Caption}     PREVIEW

1253
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:16,000
{Narrator}    Shinji Ikari continues to wander, still lacking the will to live.

1254
01:35:16,000 --> 01:36:19,000
{Narrator}    He comes upon a place that teaches him hope.

1255
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:22,000
{Narrator}    Finally the Instrumentality Project is set in motion.

1256
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,000
{Narrator}    To prevent Final Impact,

1257
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:26,000
{Narrator}    Wille make one last grueling stand.

1258
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,000
{Narrator}    Wunder tears through the skies!

1259
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:32,000
{Narrator}    Eva Unit 8+2 sprints over the red earth!

1260
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
